Serves: 8–10

Based off of [Turkey Gravy with Cider and Walnuts](https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/turkey-gravy-with-cider-and-walnuts/)

## Ingredients

* Bacon, onions, lemon and trimmings from the roast turkey
* 3 rosemary sprigs
* 3 tomatoes, chopped
* 1 litre good-quality dry cider
* 600ml good-quality chicken stock
* 2 tbsp walnut pieces, toasted
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Optional: Gravy base from Crate&Barrel.

## Cooking Instructions

1. Once you’ve transferred the cooked turkey to a platter to rest, drain off most of the fat from the roasting tray and place on the stove.
2. Roughly chop the bacon, add to the tray and fry for a few minutes. Chop the onions and lemon and add to the tray with 2 rosemary sprigs and the tomatoes. Cook for 1–2 minutes, then add the turkey wings, parson’s nose and drumstick tips and fry for a few more minutes.
3. Pour in the cider and boil for a few minutes. Add the juices from the resting turkey and simmer to reduce the liquid by half. Pour in the stock, return to the boil, then reduce the heat slightly. Using a potato masher, crush the vegetables in the tray. Simmer for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until reduced again by a third. Take off the heat.
4. Strain the gravy through a sieve into a saucepan, pressing down on the solids in the sieve with a ladle to extract as much of the flavorful juice as possible. Add a fresh sprig of rosemary to the pan, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for a few minutes.
5. Before serving, remove the rosemary and reheat the gravy. Pour the piping hot gravy on top and serve at once.
