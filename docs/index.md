# Malice Farm Cookbook

This cookbook is a collection of cooking recipes, ideas, and notes I have collected in my journey to become a "competent" cook for my family. Here you will find a collection of recipes, shopping lists, and cooking techniques that I have used through out the years. This site is always in a state of development depending on how busy I am. The entire site runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so feel free to send in a Pull Request if you have any suggestions or improvements.
