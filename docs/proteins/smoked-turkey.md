# Smoked Turkey

Based off the recipe [Roast Turkey with Lemon Parsley and Garlic](https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/roast-turkey-with-lemon-parsley-and-garlic/)

## Ingredients

### Turkey

* 1 free-range turkey (ideally Norfolk Black or Bronze)
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 onions, peeled and halved
* 1 lemon, halved
* 1 head of garlic, halved horizontally
* 6 bay leaves
* Olive oil, to drizzle

### Lemon, parsley and garlic butter:

* 375g butter, at room temperature
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Finely grated zest and juice of 2 small lemons
* 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
* Small bunch of flat leaf parsley, leaves only, chopped

## Prep Instructions

1. Remove the giblets from the turkey cavity.
2. Brine turkey at least 24 hours before cooking
3. With your hands, loosen the skin on the breast from both ends of the bird so that you will be able to stuff the flavoured butter underneath it, making sure you keep the skin intact. Repeat with the skin on the legs – from the lower side of the breast feel your way under the skin and out towards the leg, loosening the gap.
4. Season the cavity well with salt and pepper, then stuff with the onions, lemon, garlic halves and 2 bay leaves.
5. Stuff half the butter mix into the opened spaces under the skin. From the outside of the skin, gently massage the butter around the breasts so that the meat is evenly covered. Finally, insert the rest of the bay leaves under the skin of the breasts.

## Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat Smoker to 225°F
2. Calculate about 30 to 40 minutes per pound
3. Internal temperature of turkey should be about 160°F when done.
