# Spatchcock Smoked Turkey

Based off the recipe [How to Smoke Turkey in a Smoker (Masterbuilt Electric Smoker)](https://youtu.be/2jpqc9aV8fU).  Spatchcocking the turkey allows it to cook much faster while still retaining moisture and enhancing the smokey flavor.  This has become my prefered method as smoking a whole turkey was taking WAY too long.

## Ingredients

### Turkey

* 1 free-range turkey (ideally Norfolk Black or Bronze)
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Olive oil, to drizzle

## Prep Instructions
We will be essentially cutting the turkey in half, length way, use a good knife and a pair of cutting sheers.

1. Remove the giblets from the turkey cavity.
2. Brine turkey at least 24 hours before cooking
3. Using the knife, cut the skin and meeting along the breat bone, down to the bone (don't cut throug it just yet).
4. Flip the turkey over, using garden sheers, cut all along the backbone, both sides, the goal is to remove the backbone (put it aside for gravy or stock).
5. Flip the turkey back over, try pressing down on it to break the breast bone, using the garden sheers to cut through the rest (cut through the cut made earlier).
6. Put each piece on smoker rack, apply oil and spice rub over skin.

## Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat Smoker to 275°F
2. Calculate about 20 to 25 minutes per pound
3. Internal temperature of turkey should be about 165°F when done.
